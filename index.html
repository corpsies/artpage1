    <strong>WHO I AM</strong>
    <br /><br />
    Corpsies was born at twelve years old and cultivated with crayons,
    oils, and acrylic paints over the years. From physical media, I moved on
    and taught myself how to use digital media – My iPad and Apple Pencil becoming
    my favored media type.
    <br /><br />
    <Strong>WHAT I DO</Strong>
    <br /><br />
    Mainly specializing in character creation, branding, and logos, my work has
    also appeared on a Rapper’s design line, whiskey bottles sold at local stores,
    and a mural in Oshkosh, WI.
    <br /><br />
    Creating the identity of a character, company, or organization is both challenging and
    rewarding. A new creation can spring from an experiment in two-dimensional media and three-dimensional
    structure, or from a brainstorming session that produces only scribbles and doodles.
    Regardless of their intense pace or quieter moments, all of my creations come to life on paper with pencil, ink, and paint. I consider these works of art worthy of their individual stories and personalities; each with
    words to say and reason to live.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>CURRENT PROGRESS</strong>
    <br /><br />
    I've been a freelance artist for over five years, enjoying what I do every
    step of the way. An artist's dream – to have a job that's fun – is practically
    a reality. I enjoy the process of creating artwork – from rough sketches to
    final project – and love seeing my clients' reaction when they see their
    finished products. My work is all about making you, my client, smile. I love
    what I do, and there is nothing more satisfying than seeing one of my clients
    glow after receiving their new logo or merchandise. I have been told many times
    by my clients that they are "speechless" which, to me, is an incredible feeling.
    Please take a look around my portfolio and get in touch with me for any
    questions.
